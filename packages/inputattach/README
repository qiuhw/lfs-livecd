The "inputattach.c" file was downloaded from:

http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~jpc1/linux/ipaq/inputattach.c

This version of inputattach is a bit old. Newer version is available at:

http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/linuxconsole/ruby/utils/inputattach.c

but it requires the linux/serio.h file with updated SERIO_XXX definitions.

The -D_LINUX_INTERRUPT_H flag is used in Makefile in order to prevent useless
inclusion of broken linux/interrupt.h file by linux/serio.h (and thus avoid
compilation error). This is a bug in linux-libc-headers 2.6.11.2. It will be
fixed in the next version. When this happens, please remove this flag.

To use a serial mouse:

modprobe sermouse
inputattach --intellimouse /dev/ttyS1 &

Then mouse data will be present in /dev/input/mouse0, /dev/input/mice and
/dev/psaux in ImPS/2 format. This means that gpm and Xorg don't require
reconfiguration.
