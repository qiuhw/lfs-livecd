The fakecd.iso.head file is stored in pregenerated binary form in order
to avoid breakage that can be caused by new cdrtools. Append a single
file compressed by mkzftree to it, and adjust bytes at offsets mentioned below
in order to get a valid iso image containing that single file as /root.ext2.

bytes to change:

Offset 0x8050, DWORD: volume size in 2K blocks, little-endian
Offset 0x8054, DWORD: volume size in 2K blocks, big-endian
Offset 0xb8f8, DWORD: compressed length, little-endian
Offset 0xb8fc, DWORD: compressed length, big-endian
Offset 0xb971, BYTE:  compression header size (>> 2)
Offset 0xb972, BYTE:  compression block size (log2)
Offset 0xb973, DWORD: uncompressed length, little-endian
Offset 0xb977, DWORD: uncompressed length, big-endian

Uncompressed length can be found at offset 8 in the compressed file, in the
little-endian form. Bytes indicating compression header size and compression
block size can be copied from the compressed file from offsets 12 and 13
(decimal), respectively.
