I. Using the Makefiles

A. How These Makefiles Work

  There is one main Makefile at the top-level of this directory that controls
the build. It contains the instructions to control and direct the build,
including the order in which the packages are built. It also contains variables
that are used throughout the build. Inside the packages directory there is
a sub-directory for each package the LiveCD will build and install. Each of
those directories contains a Makefile with the specific instructions it needs to
compile that package. Any patches which that package needs (and which are not
part of the LFS or BLFS books) are included in that directory as well.

  Part of the build is run as an unprivileged user, 'lfs', and the rest is
done after chroot-ing into the $(MP) directory (see the Configuring the
Environment section for information about $(MP) and other variables). In order
to make that happen, the Makefile approximately runs "su - lfs -c '[commands]'"
or "chroot $(MP) /bin/bash -c '[commands]'" where [commands] is the
instructions necessary to cd into the proper directory and re-run 'make' with
the proper target. So the Makefile is essentially re-calling itself as a
different user or in a different environment.

  In the correct order, and in the proper environment, each package's Makefile
is called and run. These download the source files needed, verify the SHA1 sums,
unpack the tarball(s) into its own directory, run the build instructions, and
send the output into a log-file.

B. Configuring the Environment

  You should visually inspect the main Makefile, the one in the same directory
as this README before attempting to run the scripts. There are a few variables
that you may want to customize to meet the needs of your own particular setup
and for the type of CD you are hoping to produce. Here is a list of the main
variables to look for:

* VERSION
  This variable will be used in various places throughout the build and
should equal the version of the CD you intend to build. If you are building
this CD for personal use, you can enter anything here. LFS LiveCD editors will
follow a specific versioning scheme.

* MPBASE
  This is the Mount Point, the directory that you will be using to house the
build as it runs. These scripts (this entire directory and its sub-directories)
should be placed inside the $MPBASE directory and run from there. Default is
/mnt/lfs.

* ROOT
  This signifies the root-point of the build scripts. In other words, this is
the name of the directory containing the build scripts. A symlink will be made
from this directory to the root of the host filesystem. The default name of this
directory is lfs-livecd. If you accept the defaults for both this variable and
$MPBASE, then this directory will exist as /mnt/lfs/lfs-livecd. A symlink will
be made to /lfs-livecd on the host system. It is important that this variable
have a leading '/' as it is referenced by the scripts in both the host
environment and the chroot environment.

  All of the above variables (and others) can be edited directly in the
top-level Makefile (the one in the same directory as this README). However, if
you are tracking SVN, then each 'svn up' will overwrite your custom changes. To
overcome that, you can create a file called 'Makefile.personal' and add the
desired changes there. The original Makefile will source that file. 'svn up'
will not affect 'Makefile.personal'.

C. Obtaining the Sources

  The scripts will attempt to download the sources and book patches as it needs
them. If you want to gather the sources and book patches beforehand, create a
directory called 'sources' in the $(MPBASE) directory and place the sources and
book patches there. You should ensure that you download the *exact* same sources
and book patches the scripts use and then verify the SHA1 sums. This will
prevent the build from failing unexpectedly on a bad checksum during the build.

D. Running the Scripts

  Building the CD could be as simple as the following:

mkdir /mnt/lfs
cd /mnt/lfs
svn co svn://svn.linuxfromscratch.org/livecd/[path of repo] lfs-livecd
(or, 'tar -xjf [path to tarball]'if you have downloaded a tarball of these
scripts)
cd /mnt/lfs/lfs-livecd
make

  The above example makes use of the default variables for $(MPBASE) and
$(ROOT).
